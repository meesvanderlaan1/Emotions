Introduction:

Humanity has sought to explain ourselves and the world around us. A clear challenge to this is too explain the inner life. This question only makes sense when looked at from modern scientific point of view, where we are not controlled by external forces of a supernatural nature. Prior to modern scientific views, human experience was determined by a variety of spirits. Specific experiences was associated with a specific spirit, such as the spirit of poetry. The paradigm shift that has occurred with the emergence and dominance of scientific views has enabled massive changes in culture and society including moral philosophy, legal processes, economic structures, democratic institutions that are build on the idea of an internal locus of control. In this context of internal forces as opposed to external forces we are able ask questions and offer explanations of human emotions. By asking this question we are able to provide insight into the broad world of human experience (sport, literature, law, relationships, art,) . In this essay, I will review and critic James-Lange, Cannon-Bard and Schachter and Singer’s theories which attempt to explain emotion within a broader framework of human experience. 
The framework:

The framework is the individual within the broader context. The framework is composed of two parts, general and specific, which can be seen as me, you, us and them. With psychology and the questions that are related to understanding emotions are primarily concerned with the inner state but always acknowledge that the individual functions and exists within a broader context of relationships and groups. The three theories deal with the internal nature in the context of the external world, which are made up of relationships and groups. This broader context can be seen as sex, politics and religion which are three domains of inquiry and of social institutions. Traditionally the internal world was the domain of religion and religious institutions determined societies understanding of it. Psychology has emerged as a scientific way of knowing our internal functions. Religion exists as both specific institutions as well as a broad paradigm, which is of an external locus of control.  In the framework of sex, politics and religion, the domain of sexuality involves the question how I know and can relate too another person. This domain has seen a shift from supernatural explanations too naturalistic scientific inquiries. This domain is regulated by the cultural institution of ‘the family’.  The third aspect of our identity is politics. With this I am referring too the process of belonging to groups and the social expectations that come with that group. For example (a tribe has certain expectations). Major institutions such as government, school, police and army influence a person’s identity and a sense of who we belong to and associate ourselves is. Within this broad context we have a conception of a person consisting of three parts, physical, mental and emotional. This division has evolved over centuries and is associated with higher social and economic value given too mental activity over emotional or physical activity. This can be seen when looking at the economic value of different jobs (physical pays less that mental jobs, with exceptions). The theories of emotion attempt to explain the subject in the context of the other dimensions within an individual, as well as too understand this broader context of human experience. This essay will attempt to explain to what extent Schachter and Singer’s cognitive labeling theory explains the physiological and psychological aspects of emotion. Each of the theories proposes a stimulus-response effect, which can provide insight into the internal life and development of ourselves, our relationships and broader social groups. 

James-Lange
•	The James-Lange theory of emotion states that different emotion-arousing stimuli that come from the external world will trigger specific physiological responses that then directly causes specific emotional feelings.
•	Therefore an external stimuli, such as fear, will cause the release of Adrenaline and thereby increasing the heart rate. This is then interpreted as the emotion of fear. Physiological arousal is therefore necessary and sufficient for a emotional response too occur, according to the theory.
•	The individual experiencing the physiological response, what ever it may be as there is a infinitely broad emotional landscape, some of which may not even have words that describe it. 
•	There is a neurochemical soup within the body that determines certain sensations, which is the physiological response. The individual then interprets the sensation that is felt as a emotion and then becomes conscious of it.  
•	The theory focuses on the internal and sub-conscious process that leads to the acknowledgement through interpretation of the emotion, and does not fully account for the possibility that they’re may be more factor’s contributing too the emotional experience.
•	Becoming conscious involves labeling the physiological response as emotion, which is an active cognitive process.  Situations that illustrate how this theory functions would be walking into an exam room or doing a job interview. In these two situations it can be presumed that they are cognitively active by revising material or other forms of preparation. The physiological changes that are occurring because of this passive anxiety from the stimuli are then labeled and interpreted by the individual making them conscious that they are anxious. 
•	The James-Lange theory has a sequence of discrete/separate events to forming an emotion, which can be criticized…
•	One aspect that the James-Lange theory does not take into account is the possibility that this cocktail of chemical that leads to the physiological response may sub-consciously add to the interpretation the individual makes of the emotion. This means that it may not only be the physical response that is interpreted and determines the emotion. This leads me to question whether the implication of the stimuli itself has some preliminary effect based on the nature of the object. For example the effect of seeing a shark in the water may cause the immediate emotion to occur because of the semantic meanings that the object carries. The theory does not take into account the possibility of the individual experiencing the emotion because of the acknowledgement of danger, rather than in response to the physiological changes. 
•	Another aspect of the theory that can be critiqued is the possibility that the given emotion may not have a physiological response attached too it. Only the most basic of emotions are associated with clear physiological responses. Emotions like envy are consciously acknowledged using perception, but may lack a noticeable physiological response. Therefore the individual cannot have interpreted it from the lack of physiological response but may have interpreted based on the environment and the stimuli that stem from the situation. 
Cannon-Bard
•	The Cannon-Bard theory of emotion states that physiological changes and conscious feelings of emotion occur separately. Although they are separate, the theory also states that these aspects occur simultaneously. Therefore, the external stimuli of a dangerous object will the thalamus to send signals to the hypothalamus to trigger a general ‘flight, fight and freeze’ physiological response. A signal is also sent to the cortex in order to register the conscious emotion with the individual.
•	Physiological arousal from an external stimulus is therefore neither necessary nor sufficient for emotions to occur, according to the theory. 
•	An example of how this theory would apply to real life situations is the effect of shouting ‘police’ or ‘fire’ in a public area. This shows how the stimulus is cognitively labeled by the individual, which causes both the physiological response and the conscious experience of the emotion too occur. 
•	The key feature that distinguishes the James-Lange theory from the Cannon-Bard theory is that the Cannon-Bard theory suggests that the stimulus is the critical factor that is cognitively labeled by the individual rather than the focus being on the physiological response.
•	The James-Lange theory has a sequence of discrete events whereas the Cannon-Bard theory progressed to separating the sequence and suggesting that they occur simultaneously. This theory begins to show coherence with the idea of a neurochemical mix that then has an effect on the emotion. 
•	The complexity of the scale of human experience and the formation of emotions causes complications, which the Cannon-Bard theory in its simplified form cannot account for, such as, the composition of art work and music. These require both the development and expression of the emotions within the individual. These artistic domains are operating within the territory of emotions and human experience. For example, the aesthetic sense of beauty requires an emotional aspect that can be both conveyed or observed.

Schachter Singer
•	Schachter and Singer’s cognitive labeling theory of emotion states that emotion-arousing external stimuli will cause physiological arousal response that is then interpreted by a cognitive appraisal of the stimuli as a particular emotion.  Therefore the external stimuli of a dangerous object will cause a general ‘fight, flight or freeze’ physiological response and a active cognitive evaluation of this arousal. This evaluation is dependent on past experiences that have taught the individual that the stimuli or object has emotional implications too it. This theory works on the idea that physiological arousal is necessary for genuine emotions to occur but not sufficient since the cognitive appraisal can label it as a variety of emotions.
•	Babies are an example of how an individual needs to learn that concepts such as hot pans have an emotional implication too it, in this case, pain. 
•	This theory works on the idea of an internal cognitive loop which creates a meta-cognitive aspect where the individual is able to have an emotion and second feeling/emotion in response too the original emotion. This structure is more coherent with the infinite range and complexity of emotions as it takes into account an individuals ability too reflect and adjust depending on they emotional state they are in. 
•	Attitudes are an example of how an individual is able to feel and emotion and have another emotion in response to that. For example a person can feel ashamed about feeling attracted/repulsed by a stimuli. 
•	This model accounts more for the development of emotions and allows complexity and emergence within the process, rather than having simple sequence which leads too the emotion. 
•	Another key aspect of this theory is that it takes into account how the type of emotion and the degree of emotion are determined. It states that the cognitive appraisal is responsible for determining the type of emotion and the general physiological arousal determines the degree or intensity of the given emotion. 
Evaluation & Conclusion
•	The James-Lange theory with its sequence of discrete events is limited, as it does not take into account factors such as the possibility that the stimulus has a greater effect upon emotion than just the physiological reaction. It also makes no reference as too how the individual senses the stimulus and the biological process that leads too the physiological reaction. This theory applies more too basic and strong emotions and lacks the concept that we can have feelings in response too emotions. This bring into question whether human’s can accurately distinguish between an emotion and a thought. This is because the difference and interaction of emotions is so unclear. 
•	The core issue is that all of the theories propose that there is a clear distinction between a thought and a feeling. They suggest that in order too experience the emotion, the individual has to be conscious of it. This consciousness occurs in the labeling of the emotion through language. However the distinction between the language used too describe the emotion and the experience itself is more unclear than the theories suggest. The concept of emotional intelligence is the idea that a person is able to develop their internal functions. With this comes the understanding that individuals are capable of more complex emotional function that fit the environment they are in. People lacking this emotional intelligence are less competent with their emotions and are therefore more likely to deal with emotionally straining situations. 
•	These theories were developed as treatment in the context of mental health and emotional disturbance. In this context, the theories are limited because of the complexity and range of emotions that overload these simplified models. In order to explain the complexity of emotions, the theories would need to be just as complex. As simplified model’s they are limited and do not show natural phenomenon’s such as intuition and creativity, which have underlying subconscious aspects. 
•	All three theories end up with an emotion that is expressed but does not show the possibility of a reverse function where the individual is having a thought about a feeling. Instead all three theories show a cognition, however this is only the individual’s labeling of the emotion, but it is not the emotion itself. If you have a word for an object, the word is not the object, it is only the sign for the object. (Korzybski = “the map is not the territory” 1921-1933). The labeling of the emotion is therefore limited and would require future inquiry in order for the theories to be developed.
•	These theories also do not help in the understanding of emotional recollection. When a person experiences pain, they are able to remember the impression of the pain but are not able to replicate the pain itself. Whereas emotions such a shame follow a similar neurological pathway and when recollected, the individual repeats the emotional experience, maybe not too the same degree but is able to reconstruct the emotional experience. This raises the question about the relationship with thoughts and feelings. All three of the theories are cognitive based but do not explain why babies are able to feel emotions such as shame before they are even able to label the emotion with language. This shows that the distinction and relationship between thoughts and feelings is too this day unclear. 
•	These theories also do not fully account for emotional interactions within society such as crowd behavior. Because the speed and interactions between people and emotions is so fast and unclear that it is difficult to account for the internal functions that lead to group formation and interaction. Judgments can be made from the outcome but how this outcome occurred is often difficult to identify. Although these theories give more of an explanation when compared to historical views on the matter, they do not give a fully account.
